**My custom Sofle v1 42 key layout:**

The bottom three layers are a toggle not hold.

Features:
- Oled Displays
- Fully custom lower and raise layers to fit me personally.
- Mouse Layer, Keypad Layer
- Has a gaming layer which makes swaps the main buttons on the halves putting the space on the left active side.
- Multiple layout support (Qwerty and Dvorak)
- Support for russian typing
- Support for Mac and Windows

This layout took me about 15 iterations, each time using less and less keys. Want to try out the kyria in the future or the ferris sweep! Currently have a 42 key layout, want to try to lower it to 36 keys or 34 keys later.
