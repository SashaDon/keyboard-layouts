**MY Hotdox 76 V2 layout**

**Note: these files are for VIA**

--> layout image here.

*Features*:
- 76 key board.
- RGB, and underglow for looking cool
- Gaming layer (placing the space bar on the left until you toggle off)
- Custom Lower layer with symbols and locations I am used to.
- Fully custom layers to fit me.
- Realtively cheap

*How to use/install*:
- Download the hex files my hex folder, one for each half.
- Reset and Flash each half with the correct hex files (`hotdox76v2_leftkb_via.hex`, `hotdox76v2_rightkb_via.hex`)
- Install Via from https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases for your operating system
- Open Via; In the top left "File", then "Import Keymap", and import `HotDox_V2_VIA.json`. Now via should see that via recognized the keyboard.
- You can now customize any key to whatever you want, and without flashing or anything extra the keyboard will instantly save all your changes even if you turn of VIA. **If you thats what you wanted then you are done!**
- If you wanted to test out my layout: then switch to "Save + Load" tab on the left and Load `hotdox_win.json` **for windows**. (`hotdox_mac.json` **if you want the MAC version** of macros and other little changes, this was my brothers layout when he used the board)
Quit Via and you are DONE!

*Thoughts*:
- The keyboard was not very good at first, but after I played with the layout for a while, figured out a good one with the Lower layer that I was familiar with. Also replaced the switches for the 4 large keys with black inks which were lubed and filmed. Now the board sounds and feels so much better without the extra noise that was being made by the stabs. Overall the board feels and looks good when I import familiar features and buttons from my other boards. Not really a problem but it has a bunch of extra keys that I feel like I will never use because they are awkward to reach with any finger.

**TODO**:
- Make a layout image for board.
- Sound Test
