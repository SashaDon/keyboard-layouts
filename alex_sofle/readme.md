**My custom Sofle v1 42 key layout:**

The bottom three layers are a toggle not hold.

Features:
- Oled Displays
- Fully custom lower and raise layers to fit me personally.
- Mouse Layer, Keypad Layer
- Has a gaming layer which makes swaps the main buttons on the halves putting the space on the left active side.
- Multiple layout support (Qwerty and Dvorak)
- Support for russian typing
- Support for Mac and Windows

This layout took me about 15 iterations, each time using less and less keys. Want to try out the kyria in the future or the ferris sweep! Currently have a 42 key layout, want to try to lower it to 36 keys or 34 keys later.

- 42 key because I don't really use the top row, and the two side thumb buttons on each side, making 42 keys.

Want to move to Dvorak full time on it, but since I have to use the russian layout alot I can't, but planning to to do in the future.
